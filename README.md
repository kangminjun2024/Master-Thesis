- ### Summary
Development of Medical AI Based on YOLO Model to Support Surgical Plan for Bone Fracture Area  
뼈 골절 부위 수술 계획 지원을 위한 YOLO 모델 기반의 의료 AI 개발

- ### Background  
Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) offers valuable support in fracture detection and diagnostic decision-making. ‘You only look once’ (YOLO) v4 proves to be a suitable model for identifying bone fractures in medical images. As YOLO v4 detects fractured regions slide by slide on two-dimensions (2D) computed tomography (CT) images using bounding boxes, multiple boxes across various slides intuitively delineate the fractured area on 3D reconstructed bone images. This process enhances the comprehensibility of the fractured region within the bone structure.
